## 1) What data do you collect, including but not limited to personal identifying information?
Don't Be Like This does not collect any PII (Personal Identifying Information). If / when you invite the bot to your server and set it up using the /setup command, it will store the Server ID, Channel ID and the webhook link that it creates for that channel.

## 2) Why do you need the data?
We require the Server ID as a reference to look information up about your server in the database, the Channel ID to know whether the discord bot has been setup and the webhook link to send messages to the channel.

## 3) How do you use the data?
We use the Server ID to look up information about your server in the database, the Channel ID to know whether the discord bot has been setup and the webhook link to send messages to the channel.

## 4) Other than Discord the company and users of your own bot on Discord the platform, who do you share your collected data with, if anyone?
Currently, no one else has access to the database or the data that is stored in it.

## 5) How can users contact you if they have concerns about your bot?
[Create an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/hax4dazy/Dont-Be-Like-This/issues/new)

## 6) If you store data, how can users have that data removed?
If / when users decide to remove the bot from their server, the bot will automatically remove all the data that it has stored about that server.
